# Winick_2025
Data and code associated with Winick and Mitchell 2025
Included in this repo:
-  Trait matrix
-  Community matrices with absolute cover (file names beginning with CoverSep...)
-  Community matrices with relativized cover (file names beginning with CommunityMatrix...)
    - ** all analyses use relativized cover **
-  Code for pivoting relativized community matrices into long-form
-  Long-form relativized community matrices, formatted for use in the null model
-  A folder that contains code and output for bootstrapped observed beta diversity values
-  A folder that contains code for the null model
-  Code for calculating and plotting beta deviations using bootstrapped observed beta diversity and null beta diversity
-  Code for calculating functional redundancy using Rao's quadratic entropy and species richness
-  Code for NMDS plots and PERMANOVA of community composition

Plot numbers and the burn severity gradient:
-  Unburned         1-20
-  Low severity     21-40
-  High severity    41-60
Plot numbers and row numbers may not necessarily align when plots are empty or missing.
